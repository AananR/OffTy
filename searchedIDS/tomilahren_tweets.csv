1016404649379680256,2018-07-09 19:32:06,I would personally choose life. This is where we differ: you believe in placing it in the hands of government and I don’t. That doesn’t make you morally superior to me or anyone else. Period. https://t.co/rxYTMBgZnP

1016094563952283648,2018-07-08 22:59:56,I don't believe government regulation accomplishes that but I respect your view. We disagree- last time I checked that's still allowed in this country. https://t.co/ygWriEckgC
1016064385414909953,2018-07-08 21:00:01,Who are you to tell me what I should believe in? Who are you to tell me what my moral fiber is made of? Who are you to tell me I’m not “conservative enough?” It’s THAT mentality that turns people to the Left. You can disagree with me but don’t you dare tell me how to think. https://t.co/Ed0kyEtQVI
